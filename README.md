## Introduction

Hi, my name is Septian.<br>
I'm and applied Software Engineer. I built apps to improve processes in Mining industry.
I've been working in the coal mining industry since 2012 in the Supply Chain Management Department. So many things going around in material management. Managing goods is like several knowledge applications combined. However, hundreds of thousands of dollars invested by the company, so we cannot mess around with the poor quality of the material management system.<br><br>
